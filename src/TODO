0) Next-trigger-time for alarm, which is currently being playing is
empty (already confirmed, just to keep the whole list it in one place)
done 1) dbus method for getting all the text attributes
done 2) "fake" event, which will never trigger
3) combined remove_old+add_new_event method for atomic replacing
3) Mapping cookie=>trigger-time via Context Framework
